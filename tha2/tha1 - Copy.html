<h4>Subject - Devsnest 30 day program for student welfare</h4>
<p>Respected Sir,</p>
<p>This letter is to inform you about the devsnest's 30 day training program.
      This program helps the students to learn in a responsive environment where they can 
      grow individualy as well as a group. The program includes some of the best handpicked
      questions that have been asked in FANG interviews and other companies as well. The program
      focuses on a strong DSA foundation and also provides a development environment for the students to make
     mistakes and learn together. Please schedule a meeting so that we can take the talk further.
     </p>
<p>Thank You for your consideration.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,<br>
Srishti Pawar<br>
Student</p>
